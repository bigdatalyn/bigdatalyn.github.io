Oracle 19c ORA-65179 Tips

Since the default behavior of dropping a PDB is to keep data files on the server if you don't indicate any further.

You should unplug the PDB first before actually dropping it or drop including datafiles.

```sql
SYS@cdb1> !oerr ora 65179
65179, 00000, "cannot keep datafiles for a pluggable database that is not unplugged"
// *Cause:  An attempt was made to drop a pluggable database without
//          specifying the INCLUDING DATAFILES clause, and the pluggable 
//          database has not been unplugged.
// *Action: Unplug the pluggable database before dropping the pluggable 
//          database or use the INCLUDING DATAFILES clause in the 
//          DROP PLUGGABLE DATABASE statement.
//

SYS@cdb1> 
```







### Solution 01: drop including datafiles

```sql
SYS@cdb1> show pdbs

    CON_ID CON_NAME                       OPEN MODE  RESTRICTED
---------- ------------------------------ ---------- ----------
         2 PDB$SEED                       READ ONLY  NO
         3 PDB1                           READ WRITE NO
         4 PDB2                           MOUNTED
SYS@cdb1> drop pluggable database pdb2;
drop pluggable database pdb2

         4 PDB2                           MOUNTED
SYS@cdb1> 
SYS@cdb1> drop pluggable database pdb2 including datafiles;

Pluggable database dropped.

SYS@cdb1>

###  Solution 02: unplug and drop 


```sql
SYS@cdb1> create pluggable database pdb2 admin user pdbadmin identified by oracle;

Pluggable database created.

SYS@cdb1> show pdbs

    CON_ID CON_NAME                       OPEN MODE  RESTRICTED

         3 PDB1                           READ WRITE NO
         5 PDB2                           MOUNTED
SYS@cdb1> drop pluggable database pdb2;
drop pluggable database pdb2

ERROR at line 1:
ORA-65179: cannot keep datafiles for a pluggable database that is not unplugged


SYS@cdb1> alter pluggable database pdb2 unplug into '/u02/oradata/cdb1_pdb2.pdb';

Pluggable database altered.

SYS@cdb1> drop pluggable database pdb2;
