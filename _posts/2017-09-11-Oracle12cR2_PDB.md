[原创]Oracle12cR2_创建PDB

PDB创建有很多方法，下面介绍一下比较常用的创建方法








### Oracle12cR2创建PDB的方法


| Technique | Description | 
| :--- | :----: |
| Create a PDB by using the seed | Create a PDB in a CDB using the files of the CDB seed or application seed. This technique copies the files associated with the seed to a new location and associates the copied files with the new PDB. |
| Create a PDB by cloning an existing PDB or non-CDB| Create a PDB by cloning a source PDB or non-CDB. A source can be a PDB in the local CDB, a PDB in a remote CDB, a PDB in a local or remote application container, or a non-CDB. This technique copies the files associated with the source to a new location and associates the copied files with the new PDB.|
| Create a PDB by relocating it to a different CDB  | Create a PDB by relocating it from one CDB to another. This technique moves the files associated with the PDB to a new location. |
| Create a PDB by plugging an unplugged PDB into a CDB | Create a PDB by using the XML metadata file that describes the PDB and the files associated with the PDB to plug it into the CDB. |
| Creating a PDB as a proxy PDB | Create a PDB as a proxy PDB by referencing a different PDB with a database link. The referenced PDB can be in the same CDB as the proxy PDB, or it can be in a different CDB. |
| Create a PDB by using a non-CDB | Create a PDB by using a non-CDB |
