"_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=TRUE PARAMETER Should not be Invoked by Users (Doc ID 2378735.1)

	Per Development, setting _ORACLE_SCRIPT to TRUE is something to be used only by Oracle internally.  There may be a case where a note says to use it explicitly, but you should not use it outside the context of that note.  In general is not to be set explicitly by users.
