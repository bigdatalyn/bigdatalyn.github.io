Oracle Hugepage Tips

Use the hugepages_settings.sh to recommond vm.nr_hugepages.






#### hugepages_settings.sh

- hugepages_settings.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# hugepages_settings.sh
# HUGE PAGES are always implemented with SGA_TARGET or SGA values not with Automatic memory management
# Linux bash script to compute values for the recommended HugePages/HugeTLB configuration
# on Redhat Linux
#
# Note: This script does calculation for all shared memory
# segments available when the script is run, no matter it
# is an Oracle RDBMS shared memory segment or not.
#

# Welcome text
echo "
This script is intended to compute values for
the recommended HugePages/HugeTLB configuration for the current shared
memory segments on Redhat Linux or Oracle LInux. Before proceeding with the execution please note following:
 * For ASM instance, it needs to configure ASMM instead of AMM.
 * The 'pga_aggregate_target' is outside the SGA and
   you should accommodate this while calculating the overall size.
 * In case you changes the DB SGA size,
   as the new SGA will not fit in the previous HugePages configuration,
   it had better disable the whole HugePages,
   start the DB with new SGA size and run the script again. And make sure that:
 * Oracle Database instance(s) are up and running
 * Oracle Database 11g Automatic Memory Management (AMM) is not setup (See Doc ID 749851.1)
 * The shared memory segments can be listed by command:
     # ipcs -m
Press Enter to proceed..."
