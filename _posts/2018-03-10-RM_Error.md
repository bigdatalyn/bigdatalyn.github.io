How to remove file while happening "Text file busy"?






I met the "Text file busy" which I want to delete the unusable file.

How can I fix this problem?


	# rm xxxx 
	rm: cannot remove xxxx: Text file busy
	#



	
	
	

#### Reason

Other process is using this file now, so you can NOT delete the file before the process release the file.
Usually, there error are happening in rm/copy commands.


#### Solution

The steps are the following.

Check which process is using this file via fuser/lsof command. After get the pid and kill the process via pid.


Example:

	# fuser xxxx
	/.../xxxx: 10366
	# ps -ef | grep  10366

Kill the process via root user. 

	# kill -9 10366
