TASKS:

Section 1：Create pluggable database

1.Use the following descriptions to create 12c pluggable database PDBPROD3 in PRODCDB:

（1）To create pluggable database PDBPROD3 by copying PDBPROD1

（2）Ensure PRODCDB restarted at any time, PDBPROD3 automatically open to the same mode


2.Use the following Description, create pluggable database PDBPROD4 and PDBPROD5 in the PRODCDB：

（1）The DB11G of non-CDB database introduced schemas(HR, OE, SH) of all applications into the container database PDBPROD4 pluggable database in PRODCDB. After this is complete, ensure DB11G database remains available.

（2）Create PROD4 of non-CDB database copies as PDBPROD5 pluggable database in PRODCDB container database.


3.Create the following users:

（1）Use the following descriptions to create a user USER1：

In PDBPROD1, PDBPROD2, PDBPROD3, PDBPROD4, PDBPROD5 in USER1 should have the same identity.

In the PDB PRODCDB later created, USER1 should have the same identity.

（2）Create only defined the user USER2 in PDBPROD1


4.Create the following roles:

（1）Use the following descriptions to create a role called ROLE1:

You should be granted to all users in the PDB of PRODCDB container database

ROLE1 there should also be created in the future in the PDB

（2）Create a role name is ROLE2, it can only be granted to PDBPROD1 in the PRODCDB


5.The following description, grant privileges and roles to users and roles:

（1）USER1 can connect to grant access to all current and future container database. Do not grant additional other privileges

（2）USER2 can grant privileges to connect only PDBPROD1 container database. Do not grant additional other privileges

（3）ROLE1 can grant privileges to create stored procedures, so that this privileges can be granted to all PDB in PRODCDB



Section 2：Configuring OEM Express

1.Configure OEM Express to PRODCDB, using the http protocol, port 5501



Section 3：Server and client network configuration

1.Configuring the alias of PDBPROD1, PDBPROD2, PDBPROD3, PDBPROD4, PDBPROD5, EMREP, using the default listener, port 1521



Section 4： Configuration container database

1.Configuration the PRODCDB container database, diagnostic information is stored in ORACLE_HOME

2.In PRODCDB container database, configure minimize Redo generated when DML operations on a global temporary tables.

3.In PDBPROD2, create a permanent table space to store the sample data. Use the following description:

Table space name: BIG_TBS

The initial file size is 500m, it can be extended to 1TB



Section 5： backup and availability

1.Create a third copy of the control file of PRODCDB container database, in the directory of $ORACLE_HOME/dbs/

2.Connect EMREP database to access the Catalog database. catalog owner is rc_admin, password RC_ADMIN

ensure compatible of Rman catalog with 12c

Registration PRODCDB, PROD4 and PROD5 in the catalog

3.Backup PRODCDB container database and all pluggable databases

4.Backup the SYSAUX tablespace in PDBPROD1, and can be retained for a long time. Serial backup performance problems, please resolve, each backup piece 100m



Section 6： Enable Flashback Database

1.Enable flashback database for PROD4, fast recovery area must be in the /u01/app/oracle/flash, the size of 5GB

2.Create a restore point is DBRSP1, this restore point in the control file never expires

3.EMP_DEPT1 table under the HR user in PDBPROD1 is removed several times, the recovery column containing DEPARTMENT_NAME version, and the recovery after the table name DEPT_EMP1.
