Section 1：Materialized views

1.Configuration PDBPROD1 database, so that the materialized view query rewrite be supportted, even in the case of constraint is not verified

Section 2：Transport tablespace

1.Use the Transport tablespace method, The TRPDATA tablespace will be transferred to the PDBPROD1 database,the metadata dump is trans3_2.dmp, data file is trpdata_6.

Section 3：Star query optimization

1.Configuring PDBPROD1 database supports star queries to ensure that this change does not affect other PDB in the PRODCDB

Section 4： Configuring parallel execution

1.PDBPROD1 deploy in parallel execution, use the SYS user, do the following:

（1）Setting sh.sales table parallel degree of parallelism is the default;

（2）Configuring PDBPROD1 use automatic parallelism, take effect only when the statement object does not specify the degree of parallelism in the data dictionary.


Section 5： Partition Management

1.Create interval partitions using SH user, in PDBPROD1

  Table name: sales_history_2014, according to the 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 Year to partition

  The partition is named SAL1, SAL2, SAL3, SAL4

  Based time_id partition


PROD_ID number not null

CUST_ID number not null

TIME_ID DATE not null

CHANNEL_ID number not null

PROMO_ID number not null

QUANTITY_SOLD number(10,2) not null

AMOUNT_SOLD number(10,2) not null

Loading data using a 5_2_1.sql script


Section 6： Configuring Flashback Technology

1.Configuring PDBPROD1 achieve Flashback Archive

  Tablespace name: FLASH_ARC, data files 50M

  User name: FARC_OWNER

  the previous version of SH.PROMOTIONS table , through flasharc1 Flashback Query to Archive


Section 7： Use EM Cloud Control Configuration Resource Manager

Configuring Resource Manager to PRODCDB

1.Assign SYSTEM user as a resource administrator privileges

2.Create resource plans to DAYTIMEP for PRODCDB

   PDBPROD1 get 6 parts CDB shared resources

   PDBPROD2 get 3 parts of a shared resource CDB

   PDBPROD3 get 1 share resources CDB

   PDB can not get the extra 75% of available cpu time

   PDB can not get the extra 50% parallel_servers_target

3.Create two consumer group ONLINE_GRP and REPORTING_GRP in the PDBPROD1

Use comments indicated the group used

4.Create a resource management plan in PDBPROD1

（1）Project Title: DAYTIMEC

（2）For ONLINE_GRP group can not be allowed more than 25 active sessions. If 26 users try to log on, wait 90 seconds later, this demand will be terminated.

（3）REPORTING_GRP set the maximum number of active sessions to 8. If you need extra eight sessions ,150 seconds after this request will be terminated.

（4）In ONLINE_GRP group, a conversation longest query execution time is 5 seconds,If the query estimate exceeds 5s, the query should be error

（5）ONLINE_GRP group of maximum undo 350M

（6）cpu ratio, ONLINE_GRP, REPORTING_GRP, OTHER_GROUPS respectively 50,40,10

（7）REPORTING_GRP group should limit the degree of parallelism of 30

（8）If the session exceeds 8000i / o or data transmission over 2000m, and in any PEPORTING_grp Group interaction should be temporary to low_group group. When the call is completed, the session also return to the group.

5.daytime activation


Section 8： Tuning sql statement

1. Use the result cache

In PDBPROD1 database, set the result cache size 15m,Hr using a 8_1_1.sql login script so that the statements can be used in result cache


2.Multi-column statistics

Login PDBPROD1 SH user database, run the 8_2_1.sql script, the script queries, CUST_CITY, CUST_STATE_PROVINCE, COUNTRY_ID regular column use together. Improve optimizer These statements compute selectable rate


    3. Use SQL Performance Analyze
        (1) run the scripts 2_8_3.sql,create apps user, and password Apps1234
        (2) From the 11.2 migration to the 12c environment, provides a dump file (the user password: apps/Apps1234),

              Contains the Sql Tuning Set, requires the use of a tool for optimization in STS SQL, and the optimized SQL plan_table write in the execution plan
        (3) Dump file location for: /home/oracle/scripts,the file :appsstq.dmp.

        (4) Migration from 11.2.0.3 to 12.1.0.2


4.Evolution of baseline

In PDBPROD1 the SH user, execute the 8_4_1.sql script, and the evolution of the baseline


Section 9: Index Tuning

1. When inserting data into a database sh PDBPROD1 user PROD_INFO table, found a large number of buffer busy waits waiting for the event. PRODUCT_ID column on a sequence is used.Range scan is frequently performed on the PRODUCT_ID columns. Create an index PROD_IDX, On PRODUCT_ID columns do not have a lot of buffer buffer waits wait, and can for a range scan.
